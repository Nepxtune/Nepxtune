### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an CHIP-8 emulator
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m free to collaborate on projects

### Experience
I know basic stupid Java. Currently learning C++.

### Why tf would you work on emulators?
I've used them, you have probably as well. I love them, they preserve games + let us mod them.
So why not contribute and become a developer? Yes it will take lots of time,
but I love coding and want to support game preservation.

I am currently going through the C++ Primer 5th edition, learning basic C++ stuff.
Once I am done with Chapter 2 or ~3, I'll tackle the CHIP-8 project.

Ignore this for now:
