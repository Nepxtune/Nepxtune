### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m planning to work on an CHIP-8 emulator
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C ~~Rust~~
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m free to collaborate on projects

### Experience
I know basic Java. Currently learning C ~~Rust (later maybe c++)~~.

### Why would you work on emulators?
I appreciate them, they preserve games and let us modify and enhance them.
So why not contribute and become a developer? Yes it will take lots of time,
but I love coding and want to support game preservation.
