### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m planning to work on an CHIP-8 emulator
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m free to collaborate on projects

### Experience
I know basic stupid Java. Currently learning Rust (fuck c++).

### Why tf would you work on emulators?
I've used them, you have probably as well. I love them, they preserve games + lets us mod them.
So why not contribute and become a developer? Yes it will take lots of time,
but I love coding and want to support game preservation.

I am currently going through the Rust book.
